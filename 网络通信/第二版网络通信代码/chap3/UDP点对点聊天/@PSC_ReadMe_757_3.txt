Title: SChat verson 0.50
Description: The purpose of this application is to provide a direct communication between 2 computers in a peer to peer like environment. This code should be a great start for people who want to build a full blown chat program using C/C++ and Winsock.
This application has been tested and compiles under Windows 98, Windows NT/2000, and Linux.
I hope by releasing this source code that other people who want to learn C/C++ networking using Winsock can pick it right up and learn from my program. I know I had a fairly hard time finding example apps to learn from. Gotta give back! :)
