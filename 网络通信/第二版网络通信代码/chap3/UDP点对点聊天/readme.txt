Application: 	SChat version 0.50
Author:		Scott Velasquez (scottvelasquez@home.com)

Windows and Linux compatible
For Linux compilation:  gcc *.cpp -o udp -lpthread

The purpose of this application is to provide a  direct communication between 2 computers in a peer to peer like environment.  This code should be a great start for people who want to build a full blown chat program using C/C++ and Winsock.  I hope by releasing this source code that other people who want to learn C/C++ networking using Winsock can pick it right up and learn from my program.  I know I had a fairly hard time finding example apps to learn from.  Gotta give back!  :)

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.
